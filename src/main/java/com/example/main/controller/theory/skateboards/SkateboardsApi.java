    //todo Welcome to the theory!
    // To start put these classes into my.project.controller.theory so you can check these using swagger or browser
    // Each team member has to do only 1 assignment and commit/push it to your repository.
    // (So 2 people - 2 assignments, 3 people - 3 assignments, 4 people - 4 assignments).
    // Make sure to commit under your user otherwise the points won't count. Each team member has to score at least 50%.
    // Don't add unnecessary code (no need for services or database).
    // We are doing mock-api design. I am grading urls and structure of the methods.
    // It should still work, i.e I can access this api from swagger or browser.
    // A good source for learning about proper API design is https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design

    //todo The Story
    // Fred has a Skateboard shop in Telliskivi.
    // ---
    // Hi. I'm Fred the hipster. I studied law and music, but now I'm selling and making skateboards. Wild life!
    // Our business has grown and I need some help automating it.
    // Currently our inventory is managed by pen and paper. You need to make it better.
    // This is what I need:
    // - an overview of the skateboards we sell
    // - I want to know which ones are in stock and which ones are new (vs used)
    // - I want to order by the price or by the name alphabetically
    // and a
    // - page for each skateboard where I can see it's info
    // - button to add a new skateboard
    // - button to update existing skateboard
    // - button to delete skateboard

    //todo A first things first, please add necessary annotations to this class

    //todo B "an overview of the skateboards we sell"
    // create a method to query skateboards (plural)

    //todo C "page for each skateboard where I can see it's info"
    // create a method to query a single skateboard

    //todo D "button to add a new skateboard"
    // create a method to save a new skateboard

    //todo E "button to update existing skateboard"
    // create a method to update a skateboard

    //todo F "button to delete skateboard"
    // create a method to delete a skateboard

    //todo G, H "I want to know which ones are in stock and which ones are new (vs used)"
    // G modify correct method to filter whether the skateboard is in stock or out of stock
    // H modify correct method to filter by condition (new, used, broken)
    // make sure existing functionality doesn't break

    //todo I-J "I want to order by the price or by the name alphabetically"
    // I modify correct method to provide sorting by price and name
    // J modify correct method to support sorting in ascending and descending order
    // in addition write some examples for how you will sort using your api (provide urls)
